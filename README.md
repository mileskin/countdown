Welcome to ultimate countdown
==

Countdown is a simple scala script to be used in e.g. agile
retrospectives. It provides countdown progress status by speaking (using
`say` command line utility) as well as writing to command line.

Usage: `./countdown.scala [minutes client]`

For example:

    ./countdown.scala 3 reaktor

Enjoy!
